Kasa is a school project whose main objective is to create a web application with [React](https://en.reactjs.org/) and [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/) without using an external library.

## Context

This professionalizing project puts us in the shoes of a freelance front-end developer recruited to develop Kasa's new web platform.

Kasa has been in the private apartment rental business for almost 10 years. With more than 500 ads posted every day, Kasa is one of the leaders in private apartment rentals in France.

The site was coded more than 10 years ago in ASP.NET with significant legacy code. Laura, the CTO has therefore launched a total overhaul to move to a full stack in JavaScript with NodeJS on the back-end side and React on the front-end side.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to create a web application with [React](https://en.reactjs.org/) and [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/) without using an external library, by integrating the [following models](https://www.figma.com/file/bAnXDNqRKCRRP8mY2gcb5p/UI-Design-Kasa-FR), and according to the [coding guidelines provided](https://course.oc-static.com/projects/Front-End+V2/P9+React+1/Coding+guidelines+Kasa+EN.pdf).
